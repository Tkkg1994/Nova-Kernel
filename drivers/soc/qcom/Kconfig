	depends on MSM_SMD
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM SMD XPRT Layer"
	help
	  SMD Transport Layer that enables IPC Router communication within
	  a System-on-Chip(SoC). When the SMD channels become available,

	  message exchange.

config MSM_IPC_ROUTER_HSIC_XPRT
	depends on USB_QCOM_IPC_BRIDGE
	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	bool "MSM HSIC XPRT Layer"
	help
	  HSIC Transport Layer that enables off-chip communication of

	depends on IPC_ROUTER
	depends on QMI_ENCDEC
	bool "MSM QMI Interface Library"
	help
	  Library to send and receive QMI messages over IPC Router.
	  This library provides interface functions to the kernel drivers
	  to perform QMI message marshaling and transport them over IPC
	  Router.

config MSM_SMEM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.

config MSM_SMEM_LOGGING
	depends on MSM_SMEM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory Logger"
	help
	  Enable the shared memory logging to log the events between
	  the various processors in the system. This option exposes
	  the shared memory logger at /dev/smem_log and a debugfs node
	  named smem_log.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV2
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv2 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6's
	  ASM, ADM and AFE.

config MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	bool "Audio QDSP6 APRv3 support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Enable APRv2 IPC protocol support between
	  application processor and QDSP6. APR is
	  used by audio driver to configure QDSP6v2's

config MSM_ADSP_LOADER
	tristate "ADSP loader support"
	select SND_SOC_MSM_APRV2_INTF
	depends on MSM_QDSP6_APRV2 || MSM_QDSP6_APRV3
	help
	  Enable ADSP image loader.
	  The ADSP loader brings ADSP out of reset
	  for the platforms that use APRv2.
	  Say M if you want to enable this module.

config MSM_MEMORY_DUMP
	bool "MSM Memory Dump Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

config MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "MSM Watchdog Support"
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.

config MAXIMUM_CURRENT_THROTTLING
	tristate "CPU current throttling driver"
	help
	  Say Y to enable maximum current throttling.
	  The maximum current throttling driver enables application to
	  turn on/off CPU based current throttling by setting the
	  credit/upper limit in the CPU registers.

config MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	bool "MSM Subsystem Restart"
	help
	  This option enables the MSM subsystem restart framework.

	  The MSM subsystem restart framework provides support to boot,
	  shutdown, and restart subsystems with a reference counted API.
	  It also notifies userspace of transitions between these states via
	  sysfs.

config MSM_SYSMON_COMM
	bool "MSM System Monitor communication support"
	depends on MSM_SMD && MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	help
	  This option adds support for MSM System Monitor library, which
	  provides an API that may be used for notifying subsystems within
	  the SoC about other subsystems' power-up/down state-changes.

config MSM_PIL
	bool "Peripheral image loading"
	select FW_LOADER
	default n
	help
	  Some peripherals need to be loaded into memory before they can be
	  brought out of reset.

	  Say yes to support these devices.

config MSM_PIL_SSR_GENERIC
	tristate "MSM Subsystem Boot Support"
	depends on MSM_PIL && MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	help
	  Support for booting and shutting down MSM Subsystem processors.
	  This driver also monitors the SMSM status bits and the watchdog
	  interrupt for the subsystem and restarts it on a watchdog bite
	  or a fatal error. Subsystems include LPASS, Venus, VPU, WCNSS and
	  BCSS.

config MSM_PIL_MSS_QDSP6V5
	tristate "MSS QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) Boot Support"
	depends on MSM_PIL && MSM_SUBSYSTEM_RESTART
	help
	  Support for booting and shutting down QDSP6v5 (Hexagon) processors
	  in modem subsystems. If you would like to make or receive phone
	  calls then say Y here.
